# Scarlet-Virtual-Assistant
Scarlet is a custom-built, open-source virtual assistant that was developed using the programming language Python. I created this software as part of a human-computer interaction (HCI) research project at our school. HCI is a field that studies how people interact with computers and how to design technologies that are easy and effective for people to use. By creating Scarlet, I was able to explore and research different ways in which virtual assistants can be used to improve the user experience
