# Scarlet-Virtual-Assistant
<p>Scarlet is a custom-built, open-source virtual assistant that was developed using the programming language Python. I created this software as part of a human-computer interaction (HCI) research project at our school. HCI is a field that studies how people interact with computers and how to design technologies that are easy and effective for people to use. By creating Scarlet, I was able to explore and research different ways in which virtual assistants can be used to improve the user experience. However, this project is still under development and is not yet fully functional. I am working to incorporate machine learning and other features to make it more useful for users.</p>
 
<h1>Feature</h1>
<ul>
  <li> Natural language processing: the ability to understand and respond to user input in a human-like way, using natural language rather than specific commands.</li>
  <li>Text-to-speech and speech-to-text: the ability to convert text to spoken words and vice versa, allowing users to communicate with the assistant using their voice.</li>
  <li> Information retrieval: the ability to search for and provide information on a wide range of topics, such as news, weather, and general knowledge.
</li>
  <li>Task completion: the ability to perform various tasks and activities on behalf of the user, such as setting reminders, making reservations, and sending emails.</li>
  <li> Personalization: the ability to learn and adapt to the user's preferences, habits, and interests, in order to provide a more personalized experience.
</li>
  <li> Integration with other devices and services: the ability to connect with and control other devices and services, such as smart home systems and messaging apps.</li>
</ul>
